# E-Commerce Dessert Website

This is a simple and interactive dessert e-commerce website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The site allows users to browse dessert items, add them to a shopping cart, increase or decrease the quantity of each item, and view the total cost.

## Features

* **Add to Cart Functionality**
* **Increase / Decrease Item Quantity**
* **Remove Item When Quantity Reaches Zero**
* **Cart Count Updates Automatically**
* **Smooth Hover Image Scaling**
* **Responsive UI Design**

## Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose                    |
| ---------- | -------------------------- |
| HTML       | Page Structure             |
| CSS        | Styling and Responsiveness |
| JavaScript | Interactive Cart Logic     |

## How It Works

1. When a user clicks **Add to Cart**, the item is stored in a JavaScript array.
2. The user can increase or decrease the quantity of each item.
3. If quantity goes to zero, the item is removed from the cart.
4. Cart total and item count are dynamically updated.
